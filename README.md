# EduConnect

This website is my major project as a student of Diploma in Computer engineering.

## To install this project into your server, follow:

1. Save this project to your directory.
2. Create a database named **educonnect**
3. Or you can use any empty database and rename the database name in the _includes/connection.inc.php_ file.
4. Then import database provided in the _sql_ folder.
5. Delete assignments and lecture notes uploaded in the database, because it will create an error due unavailability of attachments. (_I'm not uploading attachments to github_)
6. Use id = _12345_ and password = _zahid_, in Admin section to create user of your own.

And there you go you have completed the setup.
Now you can run this application by starting your **php** and **MySQL** server.

Homepage of a student will look like this.
